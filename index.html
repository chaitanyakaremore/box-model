    <div>Ganesha (Sanskrit: गणेश, IAST: Gaṇeśa), also known as Ganapati, Vinayaka and Pillaiyar,
         is one of the best-known and most worshipped deities in the Hindu pantheon.[4] His image 
         is found throughout India.[5] Hindu denominations worship him regardless of affiliations.
         [6] Devotion to Ganesha is widely diffused and extends to Jains and Buddhists and also in Nepal,
          Sri Lanka, Thailand, Indonesia (Java and Bali), Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines, and Bangladesh
          and in countries with large ethnic Indian populations including Fiji, Guyana, Mauritius, and 
          Trinidad and Tobago.[7]
